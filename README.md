# Finite-Memory_Stochastic_Cosmology-A_Log-Oscillatory_Dark_Energy_Model_with_Geometric_Noise_Cutoof
Repository for the preprint Finite-Memory Stochastic Cosmology (v3.2), including PDFs, LaTeX source, bibliography, figures, and Python code. The model introduces a log-oscillatory dark energy equation of state driven by finite-memory stochastic dynamics and a geometric noise cutoff.
