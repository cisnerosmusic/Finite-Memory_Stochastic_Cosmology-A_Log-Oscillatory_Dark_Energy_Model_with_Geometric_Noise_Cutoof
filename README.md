This repository contains the full materials for the preprint  
**"Finite-Memory Stochastic Cosmology: A Log-Oscillatory Dark Energy Model with Geometric Noise Cutoff (v3.2)"**  
by **Ernesto Cisneros Cino**.

The model proposes a dark energy equation of state with **damped log-periodic oscillations** arising from **finite-memory stochastic dynamics** driven by Ornstein–Uhlenbeck noise, modulated by a **geometric cutoff** suppressing high-redshift fluctuations.  
It introduces the observationally conservative **Model 2.1.1** and the concept of **Resilience Windows**, characterized by the dimensionless stability parameter:

\[
R = \tau \Omega \in [0.5, 3.5].
\]

This framework is fully falsifiable and includes an open Bayesian validation pipeline.
